Valid when all models are true.
Satisfiable when some models are true
neither whenn no models are true.

1. Smoke => Fire is false when smoke = 1; fire = 0; thus only satisfiable
2. (smoke => Fire) => (- Smoke => - Fire) false when S = 0, F = 1; thus
satisfiable.
	= (-S or F) => (S or F)
	= -(-S or F) Or ( S or -F)
	
3. B or D or (B=> D); awlways true because B or -B  = 1.
	= B or D or (-B or D)
